# Academic-Breakout
Academic Breakout is a game I made in one week with the prompt "Escape from School".
The project's content is split into five cateogries: Audio, Prefabs, Scenes, Scripts, and Sprites. 
These are for ease of access and better management. Prefabs and Scenes are Unity files. Scripts are in C#
